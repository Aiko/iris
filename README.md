Hush my dear child, just `npm i electron` in the directory but from `cmd.exe` (command prompt) so it permanently shuts up. If you don't want to do this then:

``` bash
npm uninstall electron
export npm_config_platform=win32
npm install electron
unset npm_config_platform
```

Also install `@electron-forge/cli` globally (i.e. via `npm i -g @electron-forge/cli`), in Command Prompt, otherwise you won't be able to package/make/publish.

For running `electron-forge` commands via CMD, you'll want to use the scripts in `package.json` that have `-windows` appended to them. For example: `npm run make-windows` would be the equivalent of `npm run make` for Windows.

To publish, set GitHub token:

or on Mac/Linux:
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=c4da6d8b5243d14d57e29c4afb2f91083cc6f0a1
